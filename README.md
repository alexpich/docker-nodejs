`docker build .`

## Running
Replace id with your id and also replace port with a different one if needed: 
`docker run -p 3000:80 id`

## Processes
In another terminal:
`docker ps`

## Stopping
Replace processname with with the process name you get from the previous step:
`docker stop processname`
